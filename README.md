# Hello, I'm HippoProgrammer
I'm a CS student who:
* codes far too many stupid things
* enjoys building computers, and currently has an AMD Ryzen 5 8600G-based system
* breaks far too many Raspberry Pi operating systems
* almost always does the harder and more time-consuming programming route instead of the easier but more tedious manual work route

## My projects (_some of which are on GitHub_)
Formatted as: \[name (optional)\] - \[description\] - \[comment\]
### Currently in active development
* Building a library system (in collaboration with @SuitablyMysterious - The-CS-Nerds/Library-System) - _an absolute pain_
* Re-building the aforementioned library system (The-CS-Nerds/Library-System-v2) - _aims to make the code less awful_

### Currently in inactive development
* TV aerial revisited - Pi 4 with a TV hat running a Jellyfin server, with TVHeadend .m3u tuner integration, linked to a Fire TV - _fun, but a pain_
* PiHole revisited - Pi Zero 2 W with an Adafruit OLED display for stats - _easier than I anticipated with the new PiHole v6 API_
* Home Assistant - Pi 5 running a local Home Assistant instance - possibility of using a mic kit to link this with Assist? - _again, easier than I anticipated, with very good functionality. bit hacky sometimes though_
* Python School Tools - Quick and dirty Python script that takes user-provided timetable data and exports it in a specific .csv file format based on number of weeks of school, for easy timetable printing for planners etc. - _quite interesting, if a bit janky in places_

### Development has concluded
* Python app that interfaces with the TFL API to fetch a station list and generate the shortest journey on all Underground lines (written in collaboration with ChatGPT) - _it broke, and would have been very difficult to make work with just the TfL API, as I was trying _
* Submitting pull requests to @SuitablyMysterious 's repos whether they like it or not (HippoProgrammer/gameJam-trappedOnThMoon) - _very tedious and annoying for me, but worth it in the end_
* Flask web app that interfaces with the Discord API to provide OAuth2 signin to my Discord server (~~HippoProgrammer3/testing-flask~~ repo deleted) - _again, quite fun, but Discord dev docs are awful_
* 3D version of my Godot game, Super Forklift (https://itch.io/hippogamebuilder) - _the assets (from @DrygiththeGM) were fun to voxelize, especially the top and the bottom, and look quite cool, but Godot 3D is not very easy_
* Building a python hash library that is utterly terrible (HippoProgrammer3/python-hash) - _this didn't work and development was stopped very early_
* My first Godot game, Super Forklift (in collaboration with @DrygiththeGM) - _Godot is a pain, and we ran out of time, but it was good for our knowledge_
* Making a 3D printer play chess (@Hacking3DPrinters) - _never tested, probably buggy, but fun to envisage_
* Setting up PiHole on two synced Raspberry Pis - _a nice challenge. shame it actually made the instances less reliable than before due to the jankiness, instead of the opposite_
* Running Kodi with a TV aerial on a Raspberry Pi - _this didn't work, but has been revisited now. Kodi is not very good in my opinion_
* Creating a fake departure board on an e-ink display on a Raspberry Pi - _very janky code, very good result, very good starter project for e-ink_
* Locally hosting Moodle on a Raspberry Pi - _very easy for the most part, has no valid use case for me but fun nevertheless_
* Rewriting the Flask-Ask GitHub repo to work with modern dependencies - _an absolute pain, and nearly got it working... then broke my Pi filesystem and had to reflash the SD card. take backups!_
* Rewriting MultiWFN from ifort to gfortran (then learning other people have done it already) - _my amazing technique of 'delete cmd-line options that break gfortran' was kinda broken, and i am surprised it actually worked. going into this with no knowledge of ifort or gfortran, or fortran at all, was an interesting choice. ifort docs are awful and i can see why people use gfortran instead_
* Various other projects - _like, a lot of other projects_
