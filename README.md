## Hello, I'm HippoProgrammer
I'm a CS student who codes far too many stupid things.
I enjoy building computers, and currently have an AMD Ryzen 5 8600G, ASUS Prime B650M-R,  Radeon 760M iGPU, Corsair Vengeance RGB DDR5-6000 CL30 2x16GB, and 1TB of assorted SSDs.

### My current projects
* TV aerial revisited - Pi 4 with a TV hat running a Jellyfin server, with TVHeadend .m3u tuner integration, linked to a Fire TV
* PiHole revisited - Pi Zero 2 W with an Adafruit OLED display for stats

### My past projects
* Python app that interfaces with the TFL API to fetch a station list and generate the shortest journey on all Underground lines (written in collaboration with ChatGPT)
* Submitting pull requests to @SuitablyMysterious 's repos whether they like it or not (HippoProgrammer/gameJam-trappedOnThMoon) - lol
* Flask web app that interfaces with the Discord API to provide OAuth2 signin to my Discord server (HippoProgrammer3/testing-flask) - worked... briefly
* 3D version of my Godot game, Super Forklift (https://itch.io/hippogamebuilder) - assets made, game not so much
* Building a python hash library that is utterly terrible (HippoProgrammer3/python-hash) - it is terrible
* My first Godot game, Super Forklift (in collaboration with @DrygiththeGM)
